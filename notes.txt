//How to fetch data in a redux App
1. Components gets rendered onto the screen
2. Components "componentDidMount" lifecycle methods
3.We call action creator from 'componentDidMount'
(Components are generally responsible for fetching data they need by calling an action creator)
4.Action creator runs code to make an API request
5. API Responds with data
6. Action creator returns an 'action' the fetched data on the payload property.
(Action creators are responsible for making an API Requests)
7. Some Reducers sees action, returns the data off the 'payload'
8. Because we generated some new state object, redux/react-redux cause our app to be rendered
(We get fetched data into a component by generating a new state in our redux store, then getting that into our component through mapStateToProps)
